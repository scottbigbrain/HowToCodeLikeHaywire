# Lesson 2: Your Toolkit
Now that you understand not just what we do on programming but also the basics of code, it's time to start putting together a kit of tools with which you can apply that knowledge. Build team has hammers and Alan wrenches, PR has printers and scissors, and Programming team has [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html). As with any tool, you are going to want to get familiar with them. In this lesson we will look at what each of these tools are and how to get them installed and running.
