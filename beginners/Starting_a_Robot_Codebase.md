# Lesson 3: Starting a Robot Codebase
So here you are. You've fought all the way through the last three tutorials to get to this one. You've learned what we do in programming, the basics of what code is, and even installed your toolkit. Now all that's left to do is... build the codebase. Here we'll go over that part, looking at how to create a codebase in WPILib, as well as the basic structure of a WPILib project.

# Creating a Codebase
WPILib contains a very useful tool in the command prompt for just this use. Open up an empty VS Code window and hit `Ctrl + Shift + P`, or click on the WPILib logo in the upper righthand corner. Now if you type in `Create a new project`, you should see the following option come up.
