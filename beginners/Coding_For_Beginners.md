# Lesson 1: Coding For Beginners
So, you've decided to take the leap and learn how to code a robot. Great! Programming isn't actually all that hard to learn once you get into it. This guide will go over some of that absolute basic concepts of programming and where to go to start learning.

# What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a system for telling a computer what to do. You, the programmer, crafts commands and statements using particular words and statements, and then feed them to the robot. The robot is able to understand these commands and follow them. For example, if you wanted the robot to pause what it was doing for 5 seconds, you wouldn't be able to just write in English, "Wait for 5 seconds." You could, however, write into your program the statement:
```java
new WaitCommand(5.0)
```

## The Java Language
Just like how there are many different human languages, there are many programming languages. The one that we use for FRC is called Java (not to be confused with JavaScript, which is actually a completely different language. Confusing, I know). Java is a standard in FIRST Robotics, and is super useful for you in industries outside of FRC.

This other one is a joke but also pretty funny: [Java for the Haters in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4-HM_sCvtQ)

If you don't understand Java right now, that's okay. It will make sense with time, I promise.

# How to Learn Java
All languages have a set of basics that you need to understand before you can start building robots with them. Think of it like how you need to learn some vocabulary and grammar before you can write a Smash Bros fanfic. Thus, we're gonna suggest that you spend at least a few weeks learning fundamentals on your own time and then come take a look at how Java works in a robot specific context.
## Good Courses
We *highly* recommend the [Code Academy Java course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java), as it will quickly get you up to speed on all of the essentials needed to be fluent in Java. We recommend building a *regular schedule* where you can practice and learn every so often until you understand the basics.

Once you understand the Java basics, there's not much need for a course, as you'll get all the additional knowledge you need in the shop.
## Fun Ways to Practice
Code Academy, while it does teach the essentials incredibly well, can be a little boring. So, if you want to try building something more hands on, you can try out [Processing](https://processing.org/), which lets you make games, animations, art, and more using Java. I would recommend Daniel Shiffman's [Processing tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzJbM9-DyOZyMZzVda3HaWviHqfPiYN7e&si=), which is excellent and part of how I learned to code. This part isn't required at all though and is only for those who want to mess around with different ways of learning and practicing Java.
