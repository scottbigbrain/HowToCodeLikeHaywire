# How To Code Like Haywire (WIP)
Welcome to the 1569 programming team handbook, the complete cheatsheet to how Haywire does programming, electronics, and more.

This book has 3 main goals which it tries to accomplish.
- A guidebook for new FRC programmers
- A library of common code used on 1569 bots
- A set of standards for Haywire programming prodecures

This book was started at the end of the 2023 season, and will hopefully continue to be updated by programmers in years to come.

# Beginners
If you are just getting started in programming, we have some guides to help get you up and running! :)

# Goals
**Goal 1** - Convert all existing swerve module code and other useful abstraction and utility layers into some sort of library or at least complilation of files that is useful to future programmers.

**Goal 2** - Establish a first draft set of procedures and standards for Haywire code.

**Goal 3** - Basic guides and resource lists for anyone getting started in FRC programming. Focus on Java and WPILib libraries.

**Goal 4** -  Basic guides and resource lists for wiring and electronics in FRC.

**Goal 5** - Include more complex functionality and hardware often used on Haywire bots.
