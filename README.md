# How To Code Like Haywire
Welcome to the 1569 programming team handbook, the complete cheat-sheet to how Haywire does programming, electronics, and more. We hope to eventually build it out to a far more extensive handbook, but for the time being it has a basic guide that will get you started programming FRC bots if you are new to it.
# Beginners
If you are just getting started on the programming team, then there are several lessons that you will need to go over. These are highly recommended if you want to help us make big hunk of metal go zoom.
- **Lesson 0:** [So You Want To Code A Robot?](./beginners/So_You_Want_To_Code_A_Robot.md), a 3,000 ft view of what we do in programming
- **Lesson 1:** [Coding For Beginners](./beginners/Coding_For_Beginners.md)
- **Lesson 2:** [Your Toolkit](./beginners/Your_Toolkit.md)
- **Lesson 3:** [Starting a Robot Codebase](./beginners/Starting_a_Robot_Codebase.md) (WIP)
