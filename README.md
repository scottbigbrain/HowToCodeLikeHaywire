# How To Code Like Haywire
Welcome to the 1569 programming team handbook, the complete cheat-sheet to how Haywire does programming, electronics, and more. We hope to eventually build it out to a far more extensive handbook, but for the time being it has a basic guide that will get you started programming FRC bots if you are new to it.
